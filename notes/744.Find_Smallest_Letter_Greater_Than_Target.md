### 744. Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target

**Problem**\
You are given an array of characters letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and a character target. There are at least two different characters in letters.\
Return the smallest character in letters that is lexicographically greater than target. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in letters.

**Example 1:**\
Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"\
Output: "c"\
Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'.

**Example 2:**\
Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"\
Output: "f"\
Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'c' in letters is 'f'.

**Example 3:**\
Input: letters = ["x","x","y","y"], target = "z"\
Output: "x"\
Explanation: There are no characters in letters that is lexicographically greater than 'z' so we return letters[0].

**Constraints:**
* 2 <= letters.length <= 104
* letters[i] is a lowercase English letter.

### Solution, Javascript
```javascript
/**
 * @param {character[]} letters
 * @param {character} target
 * @return {character}
 */
var nextGreatestLetter = function(letters, target) {
    const maxIndex = letters.length - 1
    if (letters[maxIndex] < target) return letters[0]   // edge case #1
    if (letters[0] > target) return letters[0]          // edge case #2
    let min = 0
    let max = maxIndex
    while ( max > 0 && min < maxIndex){
        let middle = Math.floor((max + min) / 2)
        if (letters[middle] > target && letters[middle-1] <= target) return letters[middle]     // found it!
        if (letters[middle+1] > target && letters[middle] <= target) return letters[middle+1]   // found it!
        if (letters[middle] > target) {
            max = middle - 1                                                                    // move max to the left
        } else {
             min = middle + 1                                                                   // move min to the right
        }
    }
    return letters[0]
};
