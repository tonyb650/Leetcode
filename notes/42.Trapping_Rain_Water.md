### 42. Trapping Rain Water

**Problem**\
Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

**Example 1:**\
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]\
Output: 6\
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

**Example 2:**\
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]\
Output: 9

**Constraints:**
- n == height.length
- 1 <= n <= 2 * 104
- 0 <= height[i] <= 105

## Solution, Javascript - First attempt (Works, But Too Slow)
```javascript
var trap = function(height) {
    let water = 0
    let maxHeight = Math.max(...height)                     // what is the highest peak or peaks?
    let width = height.length                               // how 'wide' is the array?
    for (let level = 1; level <= maxHeight; level++){       // loop through levels, starting at bottom
        let leftLimit = -1                                  // initialize limits outside of viable 'width'
        let rightLimit = -1
        for(let i = 0; i < width; i++){                     // find leftLimit and rightLimit for this level
            if (height[i] >= level && leftLimit === -1) leftLimit = i
            if (height[width-1-i] >= level && rightLimit === -1) rightLimit = width-1-i
        }
        if( rightLimit <= leftLimit) return water           // if there is only one 'peak', then return
        for(let i = leftLimit; i < rightLimit; i++){
            if(height[i] < level) water++                   // Anywhere that the height is below the current level and between rightLimit and leftLimit, then add 1 water
        }
    }
    return water
};
