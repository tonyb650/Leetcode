### 42. Trapping Rain Water

**Problem**\
Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

**Example 1:**
```
|       X
|   X***XX*X
| X*XX*XXXXXX
______________
```
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]\
Output: 6\
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

**Example 2:**\
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]\
Output: 9

**Constraints:**
- n == height.length
- 1 <= n <= 2 * 104
- 0 <= height[i] <= 105

### Solution, Javascript - First attempt (works, but too slow to pass all tests) O(n2)
```javascript
var trap = function(height) {
    let water = 0
    let maxHeight = Math.max(...height)                     // what is the highest peak or peaks?
    let width = height.length                               // how 'wide' is the array?
    for (let level = 1; level <= maxHeight; level++){       // loop through levels, starting at bottom
        let leftLimit = -1                                  // initialize limits outside of viable 'width'
        let rightLimit = -1
        for(let i = 0; i < width; i++){                     // find leftLimit and rightLimit for this level
            if (height[i] >= level && leftLimit === -1) leftLimit = i
            if (height[width-1-i] >= level && rightLimit === -1) rightLimit = width-1-i
        }
        if( rightLimit <= leftLimit) return water           // if there is only one 'peak', then return
        for(let i = leftLimit; i < rightLimit; i++){
            if(height[i] < level) water++                   // Anywhere that the height is below the current level and between rightLimit and leftLimit, then add 1 water
        }
    }
    return water
};
```

### Solution, Javascript - Brute Force, successful - O(n)
```javascript
var trap = function(height) {
    let puddle = 0
    let puddleStart = 0
    let puddleStartHeight = 0
    let water = 0
    for (let i = 0; i < height.length; i++){
        if(height[i] >= puddleStartHeight){       // Ending/starting a new puddle
            puddleStart = i
            puddleStartHeight = height[i]
            water += puddle
            puddle = 0 
        } else {                                  // adding water
            puddle += puddleStartHeight - height[i]
        }
    }
    let peak = puddleStart
    /* REVERSE DIRECTION */
    puddle = 0
    puddleStart = 0
    puddleStartHeight = 0
    for (let i = height.length-1; i >= peak; i--){
        if(height[i] >= puddleStartHeight){        // Ending/starting a new puddle
            puddleStart = i
            puddleStartHeight = height[i]
            water += puddle
            puddle = 0
        } else {                                    // adding water
            puddle += puddleStartHeight - height[i]
        }
    }
    return water
};
```
