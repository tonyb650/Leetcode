### String to Integer (atoi)

**Problem**
Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.\

The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:\

1. Whitespace: Ignore any leading whitespace (`" "`).
2. Signedness: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is `'-'` or `'+'`, assuming positivity if neither present.
3. Conversion: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.
4. Rounding: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-2^31, 2^31 - 1]`, then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-2^31` should be rounded to `-2^31`, and integers greater than `2^31 - 1` should be rounded to` 2^31 - 1`.
Return the integer as the final result.

**Example 1:**\
Input: s = "42"\
Output: 42\
Explanation:
```
The underlined characters are what is read in and the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1: "42" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "42" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: "42" ("42" is read in)
           ^
```
**Example 2:**\
Input: s = " -042"\
Output: -42\
Explanation:
```
Step 1: "   -042" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 2: "   -042" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 3: "   -042" ("042" is read in, leading zeros ignored in the result)
               ^
```
**Example 3:**\
Input: s = "1337c0d3"\
Output: 1337\
Explanation:
```
Step 1: "1337c0d3" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "1337c0d3" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: "1337c0d3" ("1337" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
             ^
```
**Example 4:**\
Input: s = "0-1"\
Output: 0\
Explanation:
```
Step 1: "0-1" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "0-1" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: "0-1" ("0" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
          ^
```
**Example 5:**\
Input: s = "words and 987"\
Output: 0\
Explanation:
```
Reading stops at the first non-digit character 'w'.
```

**Constraints:**
- 0 <= s.length <= 200
- s consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (0-9), ' ', '+', '-', and '.'.

### Solution, Javascript
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var myAtoi = function(s) {
    let index = 0
    let result = 0
    let positive = true
    const MAX_CHECK = Math.floor(Math.pow(2,31)/10)
    while (s[index] === " "){
        index++
    }
    if (s[index] === "-" ) {
        positive = false
        index++
    } else if (s[index] === "+"){
        index++
    }
    while (index < s.length && s[index] >= '0' && s[index] <= '9') {
        // 32-bit signed: Has a minimum value of -2,147,483,648 and a maximum value of 2,147,483,647 (inclusive).
        // FOR NEGATIVE RESULT
        // if result > 214,748,364 then adding any digit to it will will push into overflow
        // if result == 214,748,364 then adding any digit 8 or higher will push it to MIN
        if ( !positive && (result > MAX_CHECK || (result == MAX_CHECK && +s[index] >= 8))){
            return Math.pow(-2,31)
        }
        // FOR POSITIVE RESULT
        // if result > 214,748,364 then adding any digit to it will will push into overflow
        // if result == 214,748,364 then adding any digit 7 or higher will push it to MAX
        if ( positive && (result > MAX_CHECK || (result == MAX_CHECK && +s[index] >= 7))){
            return Math.pow(2,31)-1
        }
        result = result * 10 + +s[index]
        index++
    }
    return positive ? result : -result 
};
