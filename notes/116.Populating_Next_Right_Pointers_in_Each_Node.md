### 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node

You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:

```
struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
```
Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.

Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

**Example 1:**\
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]\
Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,6,7,#]\
Explanation: Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.

**Example 2:**\
Input: root = []\
Output: []

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2^12 - 1].
- -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

**Follow-up:**
- You may only use constant extra space.
- The recursive approach is fine. You may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

### Solution, Javascript - 1st approach
```javascript
/*
This approach uses two queues: loading one with the children (to be used for the next level) and one for the current level. Keeping track of how many nodes to process on each level by squaring the level number that we are on.
*/
var connect = function(root) {
    if (!root) return null;
    let level = 0;
    let levelNodes = 1 // (2^0)
    let levelQ = [root]
    let nextLevelQ = []
    while (levelQ.length > 0 ){
        for (let i = 0 ; i < levelNodes ; i++){
            let currentNode = levelQ[i];
            // load next level
            if (currentNode.left !== null ){
                nextLevelQ.push(currentNode.left)
            }
            if (currentNode.right !== null){
                nextLevelQ.push(currentNode.right)
            }
            // process current level
            if (i < levelNodes-1) {
                levelQ[i].next = levelQ[i+1]
            }
        }
        // advance to the next level
        level++
        levelNodes = 2**level
        levelQ = nextLevelQ
        nextLevelQ = []
    }
    return root;
};
```

### Solution, Javascript - 2nd approach
```javascript
/*
  This simpler approach assigns 'next' pointers while in the 'parent' level, and then the pointers are already in place when we move on to the 'children'
 */
var connect = function(root) {
    if (!root) return null;
    let leftmost = root
    while (leftmost.left != null ){
        let head = leftmost
        while (head != null ) {
            head.left.next = head.right
            if ( head.next != null){ 
                head.right.next = head.next.left
            } 
            head = head.next
        }
        leftmost = leftmost.left
    }
    return root;
};
```
