### 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower

**Problem**\
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:\
I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.\
Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.\
You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:
- -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
- 1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
- 0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).

Return the number that I picked.

**Example 1:**\
Input: n = 10, pick = 6\
Output: 6

**Example 2:**\
Input: n = 1, pick = 1\
Output: 1

**Example 3:**\
Input: n = 2, pick = 1\
Output: 1 

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= n <= 231 
- 1 <= pick <= n

### Recursive Solution, Javascript
```javascript
var guessNumber = function(n) {
    let myGuess = Math.floor((n+1) /2);
    if( guess(myGuess) == 0){
        return myGuess;
    }
    if(guess(myGuess+1) == 0){
        return myGuess+1;
    }
    if( guess(myGuess) == 1){
        let nextGuess = Math.floor(myguess*.5)+1+myGuess*2
        guessNumber(nextGuess)
    }
    if (guess(myGuess) == -1){
        guessNumber(myGuess)
    }
};
```

### Binary Search Solution, Javascript
```javascript
var guessNumber = function(n) {
    let min = 1;
    let max = n;
    let mid = 0;
    let res = null;
    do {
        mid = Math.floor((min+max)/2);
        res = guess(mid);
        if(res == 1){
            min = mid + 1;
        } else if ( res == -1){
            max = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    while(!res==0);
    return mid;
};
```
