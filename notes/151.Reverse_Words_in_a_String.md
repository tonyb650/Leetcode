### 151. Reverse Words in a String

**Problem**\
Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the **words**.

A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The **words** in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

Return *a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.*

Note that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

**Example 1:**\
Input: s = "the sky is blue"\
Output: "blue is sky the"

**Example 2:**\
Input: s = "  hello world  "\
Output: "world hello"\
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

**Example 3:**\
Input: s = "a good   example"\
Output: "example good a"\
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= s.length <= 104
- s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.
- There is at least one word in s.

**Follow-up:** If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it in-place with O(1) extra space?

### Solution, Javascript with Higher Order Functions (cheating? :)
```js
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var reverseWords = function(s) {
    return s.trim().split(" ").filter(w => w).reverse().join(" ")
};
```

### Solution, Less cheating :)
```js
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var reverseWords = function(s) {
    let p1 = 0
    let p2 = 0
    let res = ""
    while (p2 <= s.length) {
        if (s[p2] === " " || p2 === s.length) {
            let newWord = s.substring(p1,p2)
            if (res.length > 0) {
                newWord = newWord + (p2 > p1 ? " " : "") 
            }
            res = newWord + res
            p1 = p2 + 1
        }
        p2++
    }
    return res
};
```
