### 169. Majority Element

**Problem**\
Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return the majority element.\
The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

**Example 1:**\
Input: nums = [3,2,3]\
Output: 3

**Example 2:**\
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]\
Output: 2

**Constraints:**
- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 5 * 104
- -109 <= nums[i] <= 109

**Follow-up:** Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?\
My notes from editorial:\
There are two ways of doing this:
1. Sort and then take the value at the exact center of the sorted array. Because you are guaranteed that there is a majority element, then the middle element will always be the majority element after sorting. Built in sorting runs in O(nlgn) and sorting in-place uses O(1) space.
2. Bit manipulation. So clever. Loop through bits 0 - 32. For each bit, use .reduce() on the nums array to determine if that bit is present in the majority of the elements. Then, that bit gets set in the majority_element/result variable. The editorial claims this is O(n log C) where C is the maximum value that an element can be, roughly 2^32. The only space needed is constant O(1).


### My Solution, Javascript (Hashmap solution)
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */

// A note from this: my first version was an early return as soon as a counts[element] > half. This actually performed worse than having 2 loops.
var majorityElement = function(nums) {
    if(nums.length == 0) throw new Error("Invalid input: empty array.")
    if(nums.length == 1) return nums[0]
    let counts = {}
    for ( element of nums) {
        if (element in counts) {
            counts[element] += 1
        } else {
            counts[element] = 1
        }
    }
    const half = ~~(nums.length/2)
    for (const [element, count] of Object.entries(counts)) {
        if (count > half) {
            return parseInt(element)
        }
    }
    throw new Error("Invalid input: no majority element in array.")
};
```
